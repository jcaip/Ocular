This is my attempt at creating an OCR system primarily written in python.

Requirements so far:

Python
Numpy
Scipy
Scikit-learn
Scikit-image
imagemagick

There are several parts to complete:

Text classifier
Script that pulls out relevant image data
Character Classifier

Also need to get valid training data for both classifiers
